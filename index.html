    <h3><p>What is CSS?</p></h3>
    <ol type="1">
        <li class="listitem">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li class="listitem">CSS describes how HTML elements to be displayed on screen,paper, or in other media.</li>
        <li class="listitem"><span class="strikeout">Css is not necessary</span><span class="spancolor"> Css saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple pages at once.</li>
        <li class="listitem"><span class="underline"> External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</span></li>
    </ol>
<h3><p><b>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</b></p></h3>
<ul type="disc">
    <li class="tx">Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
    <li class="tx">Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
    <li class="tx">External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file</li>
    <li class="tx">The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,<span class="yellow"> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles</span>, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    <p id="para">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a s tyle to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and itâ€™s used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p id="para">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p id="para">There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
